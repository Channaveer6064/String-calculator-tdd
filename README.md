# ðŸ§ª Incubyte TDD String Calculator

A test-driven implementation of a String Calculator built as part of the Incubyte Software Craftsperson hiring process. The repo demonstrates clean code, readable logic, and thoughtful commit history following the Red â†’ Green â†’ Refactor cycle.

## âœ… Problem Statement

Create a simple `add(string)` method that returns the sum of numbers in a string.

### Requirements:
- Empty string returns 0
- Comma-separated numbers return their sum
- Newlines (`\n`) can act as delimiters
- Support for custom delimiters using syntax: `//[delimiter]\n[numbers...]`
- Negative numbers throw an error listing all negatives
- Support for multiple and multi-character delimiters (e.g. `//[*][%]`, `//[***][%%%]`)

## âœ… Key Features

- Parses and adds comma/semicolon/custom delimited numbers from strings
- Supports custom delimiters of any length (e.g., `//[***]\n1***2***3`)
- Ignores numbers greater than 1000
- Throws error for negative numbers
- Unit tested using **JUnit** following strict **TDD discipline**

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- **JavaScript (Node.js)**
- **Jest** â€“ for test-driven development
- **Git** â€“ with frequent commits to reflect TDD evolution


## ðŸ§° TDD Process Followed

- Write a failing test
- Write minimal code to pass the test
- Refactor for clarity and maintainability
- Repeat for each new feature

## ðŸ§¼ Principles Followed

- Clean Code (Uncle Bob)
- SOLID Design
- Test-first mindset
