## âœ… Problem Statement

Create a simple `add(string)` method that returns the sum of numbers in a string.

### Requirements:
- Empty string returns 0
- Comma-separated numbers return their sum
- Newlines (`\n`) can act as delimiters
- Support for custom delimiters using syntax: `//[delimiter]\n[numbers...]`
- Negative numbers throw an error listing all negatives
- Support for multiple and multi-character delimiters (e.g. `//[*][%]`, `//[***][%%%]`)

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- **JavaScript (Node.js)**
- **Jest** â€“ for test-driven development
- **Git** â€“ with frequent commits to reflect TDD evolution
